# The Test Instance of Irish Highway Network For Charging Station Location Problems

This repository contains datasets of the test instances of 25-node network by Simchi-Levi & Berman (1988) and our constructed Ireland's highway network, developed for electric vehicle (EV) charging station location Problems (CSLP) studies.

## Contents

The repository includes:

- `nodes.csv`: Node data including GIS coordinates, classification (e.g. city, town, junction), and population.
- `edges.csv`: Edge data representing links between nodes, including corresponding distances.
- `network_visualisation.png`: A graphical visualization of the constructed highway network.
- `import_network.py`: A Python script to import the dataset into a graph-based structure for further analysis or optimization.

## Description

This dataset was constructed to support research on the **Charging Station Location Problem (CSLP)** in Ireland. It provides a reasonably accurate, simplified representation of the Irish highway network that captures key travel corridors and urban centers.

### Key Features:
- Designed for optimization and network analysis
- Easy to integrate with Python tools such as NetworkX, Pandas, and Geopandas
- Suitable for testing location models like p-Median, FRLM, or KSP-based formulations
