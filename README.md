# The Test Instance of Irish Highway Network For Charging Station Location Problems

This repository contains datasets of the test instances of the 25-node network by Simchi-Levi & Berman (1988) and our constructed Irish highway network instance, developed for electric vehicle (EV) charging station location Problems (CSLP) studies.

## Contents

The repository includes two folders sepratedly for the 25-node network instance and the Irish highway network instance:

1. **25-Node Network Instance** â€“ A simplified benchmark instance often used in CSLP literature.
2. **Irish Highway Network** â€“ A realistic representation of Ireland's highway network constructed for solving the CSLP on Irish highway roads.

- `nodes.csv`: Node data including GIS coordinates, classification (e.g. city, town, junction), and population.
- `edges.csv`: Edge data representing links between nodes, including corresponding distances.
- `network_visualisation.png`: A graphical visualization of the constructed highway network.
- `import_network.py`: A Python script to import the dataset into a graph-based structure for further analysis or optimization.
